## 1) Reading preparation<a id='reading'></a>

The readings are from a recent, excellent text in spatial data analysis.

We will read chapters 3 & 4 completing the code, including full solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter (R script required, Rmarkdown optional).  I also include pdfs of the front matter, and intro chapters 1 & 2, but these are optional.

## 2) Meeting to discuss data exercise<a id='meeting'></a>

<br>

This will be a brief organisational meeting, possibly we can discuss this for 15 minutes at one of the HARUG meetings.  I suggest we do this Wed. 22-04-20. during the meeting 4-5pm (via Teams).

<br>

## 3) Data exercise<a id='data'></a>

By arrangement, possibly 2 meetings will be required if we wish.

<br>

## 4) Present results<a id='present'></a>

We can discuss this outcome.  An idea would be for each student to choose one of the chapters and summarize the major ideas in a short presentation, possibly going through some examples with code.
